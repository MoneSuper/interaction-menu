A standalone raycast-based interaction menu for FiveM, designed to enhance your interaction with the environment on your FiveM server.

The primary goal is not to replace target scripts; instead, it can be used simultaneously to enhance script interactions within the FiveM. Nonetheless, the main factor is not just features it's because this script uses sprites and DUI, making it more demanding on resources compared to NUI-based scripts.
